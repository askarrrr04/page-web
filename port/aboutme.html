               <div class='sub-tit2'>
                   After graduating from school, I moved to a completely new city for me - Astana. At that time there was still Nursultan ha ha. The move was difficult for me and finding new friends and<br>adapting was something impossible for me. It was during this period that I faced all the difficulties of a student and it seemed that I was doomed. But it all tempered me and played a role in the future.
<br> My classmates turned out to be wonderful people and every day going to the university was more and more interesting. I applied for the work and travel program and successfully passed it.<br>To be abroad and even in a place like the USA. It turned my mind and all my success lies precisely in this trip .I successfully passed the selection process at Air Astana and started the pilot career that I had dreamed of for so long. I will call this moment of my life the HAPPiest IN MY LIFE. <br>
